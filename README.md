# Browser-Game-M1
Greeting to all my name is Edgar Ortiz.

This game is far from done and it was created using this game as a refernce (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ&t=11589s).
This tutorial was 4 hours long yet somehow it took me over 15 hrs of coding in order to get it to that state it is in now.
I also managed to keep all the js code in one file as opposed to creating multiple files like in the video 
i also rmeoved all the inline styling from the the index.html and moved it over to the style.css file. 
I will be coming back to this project in the future in order to add a start game functionality and add music/sound effects. 
This game does not restart on its own so refreshing will be necessary. I tried to keep the keystrokes within reaching distance but any key
different from letters became challenging to track on js. In other words the random letter action buttons were on purpose.
As opposed to the video i succefully added 2 attacks for each character. I attempted to switch out the sprites as well but orientation became an issue to deal
with when it comes to transitioning frames. Since some frames flipped on the x axis can make the animation loop backwards based on its application.
An attempt was also made to change the background imag. 2 hours of editing the background only for it not to be scaled properly, so i will 
be revisiting the issue as well. This game was lot of fun recreating and really challenging aswell. my commit tree will show the long time spent debugging the the many hurdles i came across. 
I hope you enjoy!
